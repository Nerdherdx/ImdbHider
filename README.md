# ImdbHider
A program that hides the number of episodes a actor will be featured on. This will be updated as a chrome extension and will only work on imdb. Browse IMDB freely knowing that you won't be spoiled. 


So you're watching a modern drama or an action filled show, and you noticed an actor will only be in a few episodes. 9/10 times that character will die off, unless they take an unexpected vacation to plothole land.
